## Jenkins Pipeline Extension Library

#### Introduction

#### Implementation
Usually such lib can be written in two places, /vars as illustrated in this project, and /src in the form of library.
For /vars, it is either written as variable or function calls.
For the variable way, the groovy code has def call(...) {} block. This is also the method that this project uses.
For the function way, refer to the user guide.
